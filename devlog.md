The project will include three Python programs: a logger for writing timestamped messages, an encryption service that performs Vigen√®re cipher operations, and a driver that connects them using pipes and handles user interaction.

I understand that each process will communicate through standard input/output streams using the subprocess module. My main goal is to get each component working independently, then integrate them to ensure smooth communication and logging. Next step: test the encryption logic before wiring everything together.
